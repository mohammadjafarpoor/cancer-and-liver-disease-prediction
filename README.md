# Discription

* The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a comprehensive research program designed to assess the health and nutrition status of adults and children in the United States. This dataset comprises a collection of surveys focusing on various population groups or health-related topics. It includes questions covering demographic, social, economic, dietary, and health-related aspects. In addition to surveys, the dataset involves medical, dental, and physiological measurements, as well as laboratory tests. Due to the encoded nature of the dataset, detailed explanations of each feature are provided in the "ColumnDefinitions" file.

# Goal
* The objective of the project is to build a regression model for predicting the likelihood of individuals being diagnosed with Cancer and Liver Disease. This involves developing a predictive model that utilizes various features or variables related to health, demographics, and potentially other factors to estimate the risk or probability of an individual having Cancer or Liver Disease. The regression model aims to establish a relationship between the input features and the likelihood of disease occurrence, allowing for predictions based on new or unseen data. The ultimate goal is to contribute to the early detection or risk assessment of Cancer and Liver Disease through the use of machine learning techniques.
